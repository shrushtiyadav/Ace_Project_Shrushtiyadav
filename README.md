# Student Marks & Grade Management System

## Overview
This program allows the user to input marks for 5 subjects and calculates the **total**, **average**, and assigns a **grade** based on the average marks. The grade is determined using the following scale:
- A: Excellent (90% - 100%)
- B: Good (75% - 89%)
- C: Average (50% - 74%)
- D: Below Average (35% - 49%)
- Fail: Less than 35%

The program is implemented in C and demonstrates the use of functions, arrays (optional), and control flow with if-else statements.

## Features
- Input: The user is prompted to input marks for 5 subjects.
- Total: The sum of all the marks entered by the user.
- Average: The average of the marks.
- Grade: The program calculates and outputs the grade based on the average using a series of if-else if-else conditions.
- Error Handling: The program includes error handling to ensure that only valid marks (between 0 and 100) are entered. Invalid input is caught and the user is asked to enter the marks again.

## Grading Scale
The grade is determined based on the following scale:

| Grade | Percentage Range |
|-------|------------------|
| A     | 90% - 100%       |
| B     | 75% - 89%        |
| C     | 50% - 74%        |
| D     | 35% - 49%        |
| Fail  | Less than 35%    |
